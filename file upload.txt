The Basics of File Upload With Django



When files are submitted to the server, the file data ends up placed in request.FILES.

It is mandatory for the HTML form to have the attribute enctype="multipart/form-data" set correctly. Otherwise the request.FILES will be empty.

The form must be submitted using the POST method.


Django have proper model fields to handle uploaded files: FileField and ImageField.

The files uploaded to FileField or ImageField are not stored in the database but in the filesystem.

FileField and ImageField are created as a string field in the database (usually VARCHAR), containing the reference to the actual file.

If you delete a model instance containing FileField or ImageField, Django will not delete the physical file, but only the reference to the file.

The request.FILES is a dictionary-like object. Each key in request.FILES is the name from the <input type="file" name="" />.

Each value in request.FILES is an UploadedFile instance.

You will need to set MEDIA_URL and MEDIA_ROOT in your projectâ€™s settings.py.

MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'media')



Following is a minimal file upload example using FileSystemStorage. Use it just to learn about the flow of the process.


from django.shortcuts import render
from django.conf import settings
from django.core.files.storage import FileSystemStorage

def simple_upload(request):
    if request.method == 'POST' and request.FILES['myfile']:
        myfile = request.FILES['myfile']
        fs = FileSystemStorage()
        filename = fs.save(myfile.name, myfile)
        uploaded_file_url = fs.url(filename)
        return render(request, 'core/simple_upload.html', {
            'uploaded_file_url': uploaded_file_url
        })
    return render(request, 'core/simple_upload.html')




project url.py
from django.conf import settings
from django.conf.urls.static import static

urlpatterns = [
    # ... the rest of your URLconf goes here ...
] + static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT)



 

MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'media/')


STATIC_URL = '/static/'

STATICFILES_DIRS = [
    os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static'),
]

Database :


from django.core.files.storage import FileSystemStorage
            myfile = request.FILES['txt2']            
            fs = FileSystemStorage()
            filepath = "static/myphotos/presc/"
            filename = myfile.name
            fileupload = fs.save(filepath+myfile.name, myfile)
            uploaded_file_url = fs.url(fileupload)
            print(uploaded_file_url)
