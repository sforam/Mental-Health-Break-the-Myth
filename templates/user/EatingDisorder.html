							<hr class="divider_30_1">
							<p>Also called: Anorexia nervosa, Binge eating, Bulimia</p>
							<h3 class="section_header small">What are eating disorders?</h3>
							<br>
							<p>
								Eating disorders are serious mental health disorders. They involve severe problems with your thoughts about food and your eating behaviors. You may eat much less or much more than you need.
							</p>
							<p>
								Eating disorders are medical conditions; they are not a lifestyle choice. They affect your body's ability to get proper nutrition. This can lead to health issues, such as heart and kidney problems, or sometimes even death. But there are treatments that can help.
							</p>
							<h3 class="section_header small">What are the types of eating disorders?</h3>
							<br>
							<p>Common types of eating disorders include:</p>
							<ul class="list2 grey">
								<li><b>Binge-eating, </b>which is out-of-control eating. People with binge-eating disorder keep eating even after they are full. They often eat until they feel very uncomfortable. Afterward, they usually have feelings of guilt, shame, and distress. Eating too much too often can lead to weight gain and obesity. Binge-eating disorder is the most common eating disorder in the U.S.
								</li>
								<li><b>Bulimia nervosa.</b>People with bulimia nervosa also have periods of binge-eating. But afterwards, they purge, by making themselves throw up or using laxatives. They may also over-exercise or fast. People with bulimia nervosa may be slightly underweight, normal weight, or overweight.
								</li>
								<li><b>Anorexia nervosa.</b>People with anorexia nervosa avoid food, severely restrict food, or eat very small quantities of only certain foods. They may see themselves as overweight, even when they are dangerously underweight. Anorexia nervosa is the least common of the three eating disorders, but it is often the most serious. It has the highest death rate of any mental disorder.
								</li>
								
							</ul>
							<h3 class="section_header small">What causes eating disorders?</h3>
							<br>
							<p>
								The exact cause of eating disorders is unknown. Researchers believe that eating disorders are caused by a complex interaction of factors. These include genetic, biological, behavioral, psychological, and social factors.
							</p>
							<h3 class="section_header small">Who is at risk for eating disorders?</h3>
							<br>
							<p>
								Anyone can develop an eating disorder, but they are more common in women. Eating disorders frequently appear during the teen years or young adulthood. But people can also develop them during childhood or later in life.
							</p>
							<h3 class="section_header small">What are the symptoms of eating disorders?</h3>
							<br>
							<p>
								The symptoms of eating disorders vary, depending on the disorder:
							</p>
							<p>
								The symptoms of binge-eating include:
							</p>
							<ul class="list2 grey">
								<li>Eating unusually large amounts of food in a specific amount of time, such as a 2-hour period

								</li>
								<li>Eating even when you're full or not hungry</li>
								<li>Eating fast during binge episodes</li>
							</ul>
							<p>
								The symptoms of bulimia nervosa include the same symptoms as binge-eating, plus trying to get rid of the food or weight after binging by:
							</p>
							<ul class="list2 grey">
								<li>
									Purging, making yourself throw up or using laxatives or enemas to speed up the movement of food through your body
								</li>
								<li>
									Doing intensive and excessive exercise
								</li>
								<li>Fasting</li>
							</ul>
							<p>
								The symptoms of anorexia nervosa include:
							</p>
							<ul class="list2 grey">
								<li>Eating very little, to the point of starving yourself</li>
								<li>Intensive and excessive exercise</li>
								<li>Extreme thinness</li>
							</ul>
							<h3 class="section_header small">How is eating disorders diagnosed?</h3>
							<br>
							<p>
								Because eating disorders can be so serious, it is important to seek help if you or a loved one thinks that you might have a problem. Your health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis:
							</p>
							<ul class="list2 grey">
								<li>
									A medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms. It is important to be honest about your eating and exercise behaviors so your provider can help you.
								</li>
								<li>
									A physical exam
								</li>
								<li>
									Blood or urine tests to rule out other possible causes of your symptoms
								</li>
								<li>
									Other tests to see whether you have any other health problems caused by the eating disorder. These can include kidney function tests and an electrocardiogram (EKG or ECG).
								</li>
							</ul>
