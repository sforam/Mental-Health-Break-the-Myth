							<h3 class="section_header small">What is depression?
							</h3>
							<br>
							<p>Depression is classified as a mood disorder. It may be described as feelings of sadness, loss, or anger that interfere with a person’s everyday activities.</p>
							<p>It’s also fairly common. Data from the Centers for Disease Control and PreventionTrusted Source estimates that 18.5 percent of American adults had symptoms of depression in any given 2-week period in 2019.</p>
							<p>
								Though depression and grief share some features, depression is different from grief felt after losing a loved one or sadness felt after a traumatic life event. Depression usually involves self-loathing or a loss of self-esteem, while grief typically does not.
							</p>
								<p>
									In grief, positive emotions and happy memories of the deceased typically accompany feelings of emotional pain. In major depressive disorder, the feelings of sadness are constant.
								</p>
								<p>
									People experience depression in different ways. It may interfere with your daily work, resulting in lost time and lower productivity. It can also influence relationships and some chronic health conditions.
								</p>
								<p>
									Conditions that can get worse due to depression include:
								</p>
								<ul class="list2 grey">
								<li>arthritis</li>

								<li>cardiovascular disease</li>
								<li>cancer</li>
								<li>diabetes</li>
								<li>obesity</li>
							</ul>
							<p>

							</p>

								<li><b>Family history.</b>You’re at a higher risk for developing depression if you have a family history of depression or another mood disorder.
								</li>

								</li>
							</ul>
							<h3 class="section_header small">Risk Factors
							</h3>

								</li>
							</ul>
							<h3 class="section_header small">Treatment For Depression
							</h3>
