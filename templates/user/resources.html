								<h3>What should you know about mental health conditions and disorders?</h3>
								<h3>Overview:</h3>	
								<p>There are many different types of mental health conditions and disorders, and a wide range of symptoms within each of them. They can be experienced on a sliding scale from mild to severe, and short-term to longer-term; with some being quite serious.
                                It's important for everybody to look after their wellbeing. Mental ill-health can happen to anyone, and it can strongly affect a person's behaviour, physical health, relationships, ability to do work, and even their feelings and perceptions of the world. With the right support, things can improve.
                                </p>
							<p>If you feel you need support, there are options available. Talking to people you trust is a first step, as is seeking professional support. Focusing on self-care and finding peers who have gone through something similar are a few other options.
                                Digital mental health resources can often be just as effective as talking to someone face-to-face. If you're not comfortable talking to someone in person, that may be the way to go. Whatever you choose, trust is a very important factor.
                                We can give you ideas on how to improve your overall wellbeing, and we can point you to the Experts and Doctors for seeking professional help, digital mental health resources that can best help with your situation.
          					</p>
							  <h3>A Closer Look:</h3>
							  <p>
								<h5><u>Understanding your diagnosis</u></h5><br>
								If you or someone you know has been to see a doctor and received a diagnosis of a mental health condition or disorder, there are a few things you should know. Things can change over time, and not all diagnoses are right the first time around. Getting a second opinion can often ensure that an accurate diagnosis is given and correct treatments are considered.
								 <br>
								 <h5><u>Learning about the mental health condition</u></h5><br> 
								 You can find out more about a mental health condition online or via your healthcare professional. It’s helpful to learn the common features, behaviours, and treatments of the condition. You can get ideas on self-care and how to manage symptoms as well as receive support. Forums can be handy for learning from other people’s experiences and strategies for coping with a mental health condition or disorder.<br>
								<h5><u>Talking about mental health difficulties</u></h5><br>
								 Peoples' understanding of mental health is growing. Many people know someone who has experienced a mental health condition. It is becoming easier to talk and share about mental ill-health and avoid discrimination.<br>
						 
							 </p>
