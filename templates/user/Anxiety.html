							<h2 class="section_header small">Anxiety Disorders</h2>
							<br>
							<p>Anxiety disorders are a type of mental health condition. Anxiety makes it difficult to get through your day. Symptoms include feelings of nervousness, panic and fear as well as sweating and a rapid heartbeat. Treatments include medications and cognitive behavioral therapy. Your healthcare can design a treatment plan that’s best for you.
							</p>
							<h4 class="section_header small">->Overview</h3><br>
								
							<h3 class="section_header small">What is an anxiety disorder?</h3>
							<br>
							<p>
								An anxiety disorder is a type of mental health condition. If you have an anxiety disorder, you may respond to certain things and situations with fear and dread. You may also experience physical signs of anxiety, such as a pounding heart and sweating.
							</p>
							<p>
								It’s normal to have some anxiety. You may feel anxious or nervous if you have to tackle a problem at work, go to an interview, take a test or make an important decision. And anxiety can even be beneficial. For example, anxiety helps us notice dangerous situations and focuses our attention, so we stay safe.
							</p>
							<p>
								But an anxiety disorder goes beyond the regular nervousness and slight fear you may feel from time to time. An anxiety disorder happens when:
							</p>
							<ul class="list2 grey">
								<li>Anxiety interferes with your ability to function.</li>
								<li>You often overreact when something triggers your emotions.</li>
								<li>You can’t control your responses to situations.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>
								Anxiety disorders can make it difficult to get through the day. Fortunately, there are several effective treatments for anxiety disorders.
							</p>
							<h3 class="section_header small">Who is at risk for anxiety disorders?</h3>
							<hr class="divider_30_1">
							<p>
								A mix of genetic and environmental factors can raise a person’s risk for developing anxiety disorders. You may be at higher risk if you have or had:
							</p>
							<ul class="list2 grey">
								<li>Certain personality traits, such as shyness or behavioral inhibition — feeling uncomfortable with, and avoiding, unfamiliar people, situations or environments.		
								</li>
								<li>
									Stressful or traumatic events in early childhood or adulthood.
								</li>
								<li>
									Family history of anxiety or other mental health conditions.
								</li>
								<li>
									Certain physical conditions, including thyroid problems and heart arrhythmias (unusual heart rhythms).
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p>
								Anxiety disorders occur more often in women. Researchers are still studying why that happens. It may come from women’s hormones, especially those that fluctuate throughout the month. The hormone testosterone may play a role, too — men have more, and it may ease anxiety. It’s also possible that women are less likely to seek treatment, so the anxiety worsens.
							</p>
							<h3 class="section_header small">What are the types of anxiety disorders?</h3>
							<br>
							<p>
								There are several types of anxiety disorders, including:
							</p>
							<ul class="list2 grey">
								<li>Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD).</li>
								<li>Panic Disorder</li>
								<li>Phobias</li>
								<li>Separation anxiety.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>
								Other mental health conditions share features with anxiety disorders. These include post-traumatic stress disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder.
							</p>
							<h3 class="section_header small">What is generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)?</h3>
							<br>
							<p>
								With GAD, you may feel extreme and unrealistic worry and tension — even if there’s nothing to trigger these feelings. Most days, you may worry a lot about various topics, including health, work, school and relationships. You may feel that the worry continues from one thing to the next.
							</p>
							<p>
								Physical symptoms of GAD can include restlessness, difficulty concentrating and sleeping problems.
							</p>
							<h3 class="section_header small">What is a Panic Disorder?</h3>
							<br>
							<p>
								If you have a panic disorder, you get intense, sudden panic attacks. These attacks often feature stronger, more intense feelings than other types of anxiety disorders.
							</p>
							<p>
								The feelings of terror may start suddenly and unexpectedly or they may come from a trigger, like facing a situation you dread. Panic attacks can resemble heart attacks. If there’s any chance you’re experiencing a heart attack, go to the emergency room. It’s better to err on the side of caution and have a healthcare professional check you.
							</p>
							<p>
								During a panic attack, you may experience:
							</p>
							<ul class="list2 grey">
								<li>
									Sweating.
								</li>
								<li>
									Heart Palpitations(feeling like your heart is pounding).
								</li>
								<li>
									Chest-Pain
								</li>
								<li>
									Feeling of choking, which can make you think you’re having a heart attack or “going crazy.”
								</li>

							</ul>
							<p>
								Panic attacks are very upsetting. People with panic disorder often spend a lot of time worrying about the next panic attack. They also try to avoid situations that might trigger an attack.
							</p>
							<h3 class="section_header small">What are phobias?</h3>
							<br>
							<p>
								Phobias are an intense fear of certain situations or objects. Some of these fears may make sense, such as a fear of snakes. But often, the level of fear doesn’t match the situation.
							</p>
							<p>
								Like with other anxiety disorders, you may spend a lot of time trying to avoid situations that may trigger the phobia.
							</p>
							<p>
								A specific phobia, or a simple phobia, is an intense fear of a particular object or situation. It may cause you to avoid everyday situations. Some specific phobias include fear of:
							</p>
							<ul class="list2 grey">
								<li>Animals, such as spiders, dogs or snakes.</li>
								<li>Blood</li>
								<li>Flying</li>
								<li>Height</li>
								<li>Injections(Shots)</li>
							</ul>
							
							<h3 class="section_header small">Social Anxiety Disorder</h3>
							<br>
							<p>
								Healthcare providers used to call this condition social phobia. You may have overwhelming worry and self-consciousness with daily social situations. You may worry about others judging you or you may be anxious that you’ll embarrass yourself or open yourself up to ridicule. People with social anxiety disorder may avoid social situations entirely.
							</p>
							<h3 class="section_header small">Agoraphobia</h3>
						<br>
							<p>
								If you have agoraphobia, you may have an intense fear of being overwhelmed or unable to get help. Usually, you have a fear of two or more of these environments:
							</p>
							<ul class="list2 grey">
								<li>
									Enclosed spaces.
								</li>
								<li>Lines or crowds.</li>
								<li>
									Open spaces.
								</li>
								<li>
									Places outside your house.
								</li>
								<li>
									Public transportation.
								</li>

							</ul>
							<p>
								In severe situations, a person with agoraphobia may not leave the house at all. They’re so terrified of having a panic attack in public that they prefer to stay inside.
							</p>
							<h3 class="section_header small">What is separation anxiety disorder?</h3>
						<br>
							<p>
								This condition mostly happens to children or teens, who may worry about being away from their parents. Children with separation anxiety disorder may fear that their parents will be hurt in some way or not come back as promised. It happens a lot in preschoolers. But older children and adults who experience a stressful event may have separation anxiety disorder as well.
							</p>
							<h3 class="section_header small">How common are anxiety disorders?</h3>
						<br>
							<p>
								Anxiety disorders are the most common mental health conditions in the U.S. They affect about 40 million Americans. They happen to nearly 30% of adults at some point. Anxiety disorders most often begin in childhood, adolescence or early adulthood.
							</p>
							<br>
							<h4 class="section_header small">->Symptoms and causes</h3><br>
							<h3 class="section_header small">What causes anxiety disorders?</h3>
						<br>
							<p>
								Anxiety disorders are like other forms of mental illness. They don’t come from personal weakness, character flaws or problems with upbringing. But researchers don’t know exactly what causes anxiety disorders. They suspect a combination of factors plays a role:
							</p>
							<ul class="list2 grey">
								<li>
									<b>Chemical imbalance:</b>Severe or long-lasting stress can change the chemical balance that controls your mood. Experiencing a lot of stress over a long period can lead to an anxiety disorder.
								</li>
								<li>
									<b>Environmental factors:</b>Experiencing a trauma might trigger an anxiety disorder, especially in someone who has inherited a higher risk to start.
								</li>
								<li>
									<b>Heredity:</b>Anxiety disorders tend to run in families. You may inherit them from one or both parents, like eye color.
								</li>
							</ul>
							<h3 class="section_header small">What are the symptoms of an anxiety disorder?</h3>
						<br>
													<p>
								Symptoms vary depending on the type of anxiety disorder you have. General symptoms of an anxiety disorder include:
							</p>
							<b>Physical Symptoms</b><br>
							<ul class="list2 grey">
								<li>
									Cold or sweaty hands.
								</li>
								<li>
									Dry Mouth.
								</li>
								<li>
									Heart palpitations.
								</li>
								<li>
									Nausea.
								</li>
								<li>
									Muscle Tension.
								</li>
								<li>
									Numbness or tingling in feet or hands.
								</li>
								<li>
									Shortness of breath.
								</li>
							</ul>
							<b>Mental  Symptoms</b><br>
							<ul class="list2 grey">
								<li>Feeling panic, fear and uneasiness.</li>
								<li>Nightmares.</li>
								<li>Repeated thoughts or flashbacks of traumatic experiences.</li>
								<li>Uncontrollable, obsessive thoughts.</li>
							</ul>
							<b>Behavorial  Symptoms</b><br>
							<ul class="list2 grey">
								<li>Inability to be still and calm.</li>
								<li>Ritualistic behaviors, such as washing hands repeatedly.</li>
								<li>Trouble sleeping.</li>
								</ul>
								<br>
							<h4 class="section_header small">->Diagnosis and Tests </h3><br>
							<h3 class="section_header small">How are anxiety disorders diagnosed?</h3>
						<br>
							<p>
								If you have symptoms of an anxiety disorder, talk to your healthcare provider. They’ll start with a complete medical history and physical examination.
							</p>
							<p>
								There are no lab tests or scans that can diagnose anxiety disorders. But your provider may run some of these tests to rule out physical conditions that may be causing symptoms.
							</p>
							<h3 class="section_header small">Who can diagnose anxiety disorders?</h3>
					<br>
							<p>
								If your provider finds no signs of physical illness, they may refer you to a psychiatrist or psychologist. These mental health professionals specialize in diagnosing and treating mental illnesses. They may use specially designed interview and assessment tools to figure out if you have an anxiety disorder. Typically, the provider bases a diagnosis on:
							</p>
							<ul class="list2 grey">
								<li>
									Your reported symptoms, including how intense they are and how long they last.
								</li>
								<li>
									Discussion of how the symptoms interfere with your daily life.
								</li>
								<li>
									The provider’s observation of your attitude and behavior.
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p>
								Providers also consult the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). The American Psychiatric Association publishes the DSM-5. It’s the standard reference manual for diagnosing mental illnesses.
