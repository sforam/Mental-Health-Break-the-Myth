The website "Mental-Health-Break-the-Myth" is designed to assist people with mental health issues using Python and the Django framework. It features four main panels: admin, doctor, expert, and user. Users can schedule phone and video call appointments, book events, give self-assessment tests, and access FAQs. The website also provides a variety of mental health information through images, text, and videos.
